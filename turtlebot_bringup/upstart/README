To install upstart files, use install.bash in this directory.

To set up for the default wireless interface, do:

$ sudo ./install.bash

For usb0 (tethered to a Xoom), do:

$ sudo ./install.bash usb0

This copies the files while doing a search/replace on "wlan0" to
whatever argument you give it.

turtlebot-start and turtlebot-stop look for /etc/ros/setup.bash, and
if it exists they use it instead of /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash.
So to point the robot at a dev directory, just make your own
setup.bash and make /etc/ros/setup.bash a symlink to it.

To use the installed version of the code, remove /etc/ros/setup.bash
or make it a symlink to /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash.
